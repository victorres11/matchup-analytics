## üîÑ Two Special Teams Formats

### **Simple Format** (`{team}_kicking_specialists.csv`)
- **Purpose**: Basic kicking/punting statistics
- **Used for**: Kicking specialists display
- **Format**: `Category,Jersey,Player_Name,Attempts,Returns,Yards,YPA,TDs`

### **Complex Format** (`{team}_special_teams_season.csv`)
- **Purpose**: Detailed special teams participation
- **Used for**: Special teams charts and filtering
- **Format**: `Player,#,POS,Games,TOT,KRET,KCOV,PRET,PCOV,FGBLK,FGK`

### üö´ **BYE Week Handling**
**Important**: The system now automatically handles BYE weeks properly:

- **‚úÖ DO**: Skip BYE weeks in your CSV files
  - If Week 5 is a BYE, go from Week 4 to Week 6
  - Don't include Week 5 rows in summary.csv
  - Don't include Week5_Snaps/Week5_Started columns in player CSV files

- **‚ùå DON'T**: Include BYE week data
  - Don't add rows with "Bye Week" as opponent
  - Don't add columns for BYE weeks in player data

- **üéØ Example**: Purdue's schedule (Week 5 is BYE)
  ```
  Week,Opponent,Date,Final_Score_Team,Final_Score_Opponent,Home_Away,Offense_Snaps,Defense_Snaps
  1,BALLST,Sat Aug 30,31,0,Home,60,53
  2,SOUILL,Sat Sep 06,34,17,Home,79,60
  3,USCTRO,Sat Sep 13,17,33,Home,71,70
  4,NOTRED,Sat Sep 20,30,56,Away,71,64
  6,ILLINO,Sat Oct 04,27,43,Home,77,65
  ```

- **üîß The conversion script automatically**:
  - Detects which weeks exist in your data
  - Only processes weeks that have actual games
  - Skips missing weeks (BYE weeks)
  - Creates charts and tables for actual games only

### **6. Roster JSON Format**

**File**: `{team}_number_roster.json`

**Structure**:
```json

      "name": "Jackson Carpenter",
      "class": "Fr.",
      "height": "6-1",
      "weight": 200
    },
    {
      "number": 15,
      "name": "Dylan Raiola",
      "class": "Fr.",
      "height": "6-3",
      "weight": 220
    }
  ]
}
```

**Field Descriptions**:

## üìä Data Quality Checklist

### **Before Processing Data**:
- [ ] All CSV files have correct headers
- [ ] Player names match exactly between files
- [ ] Jersey numbers are consistent (D prefix for defense)
- [ ] Position codes use standard abbreviations
- [ ] Snap counts are integers (0 for no snaps)
- [ ] Started values are true/false (offense) or TRUE/FALSE (defense)
- [ ] Roster JSON is valid and matches CSV names
- [ ] Game summary has all required weeks

### **Common Issues to Avoid**:
- ‚ùå Inconsistent player name spelling
- ‚ùå Missing D prefix on defense jersey numbers
- ‚ùå Wrong position codes (e.g., "Cornerback" instead of "CB")
- ‚ùå Mixed case in started values
- ‚ùå Missing weeks in game summary
- ‚ùå Invalid JSON in roster file

---

## üîß File Naming Convention

### **Required Pattern**:
```
{team_name}_{data_type}.csv
```

### **Examples**:
- `nebraska_offense.csv`
- `michigan_defense.csv`
- `ohio-state_kicking_specialists.csv`
- `penn-state_special_teams_season.csv`
- `maryland_summary.csv`
- `rutgers_number_roster.json`

### **Team Name Rules**:
- Use lowercase
- Use hyphens for spaces (ohio-state, penn-state)
- No special characters
- Keep consistent across all files

---

## üìû Support

If you encounter issues with data formatting:

1. **Check existing teams** (Nebraska, Maryland) for reference
2. **Validate CSV headers** match the examples exactly
3. **Test with sample data** before processing full dataset
4. **Check browser console** for JavaScript errors
5. **Verify JSON syntax** for roster files

---

## üéØ Quick Start Template

Use this template to get started:

```bash
# 1. Setup team structure
node scripts/setup_new_team.js your-team

# 2. Replace template files with your data
# 3. Follow the CSV formats above
# 4. Process the data
node scripts/convert_team_data.js your-team

# 5. Test the page
# Open: http://localhost:8001/pages/your-team.html
```

## Missing Game Indicators

The analytics system includes a visual indicator for players who miss games due to injury or other reasons:

### How It Works
- **Trigger**: When a player has 10% or more of team snaps in the previous week but gets 0 snaps in the current week
- **Visual**: A small bar (5 snaps height) with diagonal stripe pattern appears in the chart
- **Purpose**: Helps identify injured or absent players visually

### Example Scenario
- Player has 15 snaps out of 60 total team snaps (25%) in Week 2
- Player gets 0 snaps in Week 3
- Result: Small diagonal-patterned bar appears in Week 3 chart

### Technical Details
- Uses `createDiagonalPattern()` function to generate the visual pattern
- Calculates 10% threshold dynamically based on team's total snaps for each week
- Applied to both offense and defense position-specific charts
- Does not appear for BYE weeks
